# strapi-plugin-account

This plugins was created with the purpose to improve some functionalities to default user account provided by plugin `strapi-plugin-users-permissions`, it because default `users-permissions` behavior doesnt attend the business rules of yours project, like create an associated model within the body of users create endpoint like below:

```json
{
    "email": "hello@world.com",
    "username": "helloworld",
    "password": "supersecret",
    "address": {
        "country": "EUA",
        "state": "NY",
        "city": "New York",
        "lat": "40.6974034",
        "lng": "-74.1197637"
    }
}
```
So, imagine that your users cannot be created without an address, then it allows a combined creation in just one query. But in this case, the property `address` is not validated and creating a user without this property will pass, because that, this plugin make uses of another plugin `strapi-plugin-validator` that allows you to create a customized validation for this query. For this example, you must to follow the steps below:

1 - Create a Content-Type for your address on strapi admin panel.

2 - Create a file `validators.json` for your address on path `api/address/config`

3 - Put the following content inside address validation config `api/address/config/validators.json`:

_`It will inherit a default validation config for address content-type, but you can improve yourself validations`_

```json
{
  "validators": {
      "address": {
          "model": "api.address.models.address"
      }
  }
}
```

4 - Create a file `validators.json` on path `extensions/account/config`.

5 - Put the following content inside `extensions/account/config/validators.json`:

_`It will inherit a default validation config for user content-type, and aggregate a validation for address`_


```json
{
  "validators": {
    "create": {
      "model": "plugins.users-permissions.models.user",
      "rules": {
        "address": {
          "rule": "required",
          "validator": "api.address.config.validators.address"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
And tada, if you try to create a new user without address, it will not pass, but if you inform all data correctly, it will pass and create the user plus the address relationated with it.
